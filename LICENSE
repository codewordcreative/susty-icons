I've deliberately used a permissive MIT License to encourage broad adoption of more
sustainable icons everywhere. While not required under the MIT License, Iâ€™d still 
appreciate it if you let me know when you redistribute them.

The copyright notice and MIT License below must be included with any redistribution
(modified or unmodified). You also cannot claim authorship of these icons.

Failure to include the copyright notice, misrepresent authorship, or sell the icons
as your own work would constitute copyright infringement.
